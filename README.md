# About 

As many baseball fans and enthusiasts know, one of the traditions of the great american past time is scorekeeping! Scorekeeping and statistics have always been a huge and exciting part of the game. It is why baseball cards have traditionally been so sought after, because there are stats on the back of the cards that indicate a player's performance. Baseball card is looking to put a scorecard on every baseball player's phone so they can review and read the game after it is over. This way they can keep a count of how their teammates have performed and how they have performed as an individual.

### Lineups

At the beginning of the app experience, you will be asked to fill out the line up cards for both the home and away team. There are nine textfields that will ask for each player's name and once both lineups have been completed you will be ready to 'Play Ball!'. These Lineups will be sent over to the following View Controller where the game will take place.

### Play Ball!

As is a rule of the game, the game will start in the Top of the First inning.
The view will load an empty baseball field with a batter image at home plate to indicate that there is a hitter up at bat. The outcome of the at bat will be entered by pressing one of the buttons for the possible options - ["Out", "Single", "Double", "Triple", "Home Run"]. If anything other that a "Home Run" or "Out" is selected than a 'Runner' image will appear at the appropriate base (Single - First base, Double - Second base, Triple - Third base). As a team bats around and scores their runners, the tally of runs will be kept up with on the scoreboard and will keep count of the runs scored. Once the offensive team has reached three outs, the field will again be wiped clean of any runners, and the status will change to next half inning, indicating the teams have swithched from offense/defense.
The game is over after 9 innings and will show whether the home or away team has won.

### Post Game

At the end of the game, the player will be asekd if they'd like to save the game and the game will be saved in a text-only format that will read out the game's play by play.
